  <h1>Bamboo bow</h1>
  
  <p>Emulating the Bhutanese bamboo bows, made by tying two bamboo slats,
  then tapering and tillering. The biggest differences are that the outside
  of the bamboo is the back (away from the archer) rather than the belly of
  the bow, and it's wider than the Bhutanese bows. Bends too much at the
  handle... I also had to make it shorter because it was too weak. The bamboo
  is too thin.
