  <h1>Needfinding</h1>

  <p>
  I must interview people to find their needs. A1 is my life now.
  </p>

  <p>
  Perhaps a need for users of this site is to have a nice, accessible menu,
  rather than having to rely on the back button to return to the index or
  navigate to other pages. Rather clunky.
  </p>

  <p>
  It would be nice if the pictures were aligned, etc, but that's not really
  a need? Though mobile users would get less of a headache.
  </p>

  <p>
  Need to sleep. I also need to sleep. But sometimes I don't really have
  a choice. Or I throw it away.
